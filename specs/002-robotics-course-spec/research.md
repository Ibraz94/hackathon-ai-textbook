# Research Plan: Robotics Course Content Specification

**Feature Branch**: `002-robotics-course-spec`
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Purpose**: To gather necessary information and best practices for implementing the Robotics Course Content Specification.

## Research Topics

These topics are critical for informing the design and implementation of the course content structure and integration of technical details.

- **R001**: Best practices for structuring multi-part course modules within Docusaurus docs, considering hierarchical navigation and content discoverability.
- **R002**: Strategies for embedding and presenting interactive ROS 2 (URDF, message passing) code examples effectively within Docusaurus.
- **R003**: Methods for integrating and documenting Gazebo and Unity simulation environments, including sensor simulation best practices, within the Docusaurus platform.
- **R004**: Optimal approaches for explaining NVIDIA Isaac Sim/SDKs, VSLAM, and robot manipulation concepts through Docusaurus content.
- **R005**: Techniques for documenting Vision-Language-Action (VLA) concepts, LLM integration, and multimodal perception in Docusaurus.
- **R006**: Guidelines for clearly outlining hardware requirements (RTX GPUs, NVIDIA Jetson kits, RealSense D435i) and their specific use cases within modules.
