I have successfully created a new feature specification for the Docusaurus Textbook Setup.

**Branch:** `001-robotics-textbook-setup`
**Specification File:** `specs/001-robotics-textbook-setup/spec.md`
**Checklist:** `specs/001-robotics-textbook-setup/checklists/requirements.md`

The specification has been created and validated. It is ready for the next phase. You can now run `/sp.plan` to create a technical plan for this feature.
