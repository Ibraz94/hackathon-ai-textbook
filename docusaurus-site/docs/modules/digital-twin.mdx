# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module explores the concept of digital twins in robotics, focusing on how virtual environments like Gazebo and Unity can be used for simulation, testing, and development of robotic systems without the need for physical hardware. We will cover sensor simulation and environment modeling.

## Focus Areas

This module covers the following key topics and technologies:

*   **Robotics Simulation**: Understanding the role of digital twins in robotics development.
*   **Gazebo Simulation**: Creating and interacting with simulated robotic environments.
*   **Unity Simulation**: Utilizing Unity for high-fidelity robotics simulation, especially with ROS 2 integration.
*   **Sensor Simulation**: Simulating various sensor data (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, IMU) within virtual environments.
*   **Environment Modeling**: Building realistic and complex virtual worlds for robotic agents.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

*   **KLO 1**: Understand the benefits and applications of digital twin technology in robotics.
    *   *Example*: Students can explain how simulation accelerates robotics development cycles.
*   **KLO 2**: Create and customize basic robotic simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity.
    *   *Example*: Students can import a URDF model into Gazebo and control a robot in a simulated world.
*   **KLO 3**: Implement and interpret simulated sensor data (e.g., camera feeds, depth maps) within a digital twin.
    *   *Example*: Students can configure a simulated camera in Unity and process its output.

## Hardware Requirements (Optional, if applicable)

This module primarily focuses on simulation, so physical hardware is not strictly required. However, a powerful GPU is recommended for optimal performance in Unity and Gazebo.

*   **NVIDIA RTX GPU**: Recommended for high-fidelity Unity and Gazebo simulations.

### Cloud/Virtual Access

Cloud-based simulation platforms (e.g., AWS RoboMaker, NVIDIA Isaac Sim on cloud) or high-performance virtual machines can be utilized for running complex Gazebo and Unity simulations, abstracting away the need for powerful local hardware. Refer to the [Hardware Context](/docs/hardware-context) section for more details.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this module, students should have a basic understanding of:

*   Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) concepts.
*   Basic 3D modeling concepts (optional but helpful).
*   Python or C++ programming.
