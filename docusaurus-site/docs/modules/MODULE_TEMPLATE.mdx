# Module X: [Module Title]

[Brief overview of the module's content, purpose, and what students will achieve.]

## Focus Areas

This module covers the following key topics and technologies:

*   [Focus Area 1 (e.g., ROS 2 Concepts, URDF)]
*   [Focus Area 2 (e.g., Message Passing, Services, Actions)]
*   [Focus Area 3 (e.g., Building ROS 2 Packages)]
*   ...

## Key Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

*   **KLO 1**: [Measurable statement of what students will know or be able to do]
    *   [Example: Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 and its components.]
*   **KLO 2**: [Measurable statement]
    *   [Example: Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services.]
*   **KLO 3**: [Measurable statement]
    *   [Example: Develop and simulate URDF models of robots.]
*   ...

## Hardware Requirements (Optional, if applicable)

This module may utilize the following hardware components for practical exercises:

*   **[Hardware Component Name]**: [Brief description of its role]
    *   [Example: **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**: For deploying and testing ROS 2 applications on an edge device.]
*   **[Hardware Component Name]**: [Brief description of its role]
    *   [Example: **RealSense D435i Sensor**: For visual perception tasks like depth sensing and object detection.]
*   ...

### Cloud/Virtual Access

Where physical hardware is not available, students may be able to utilize cloud instances or virtual environments for practical exercises. Refer to the [Hardware Context](/docs/hardware-context) section for more details.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this module, students should have a basic understanding of:
