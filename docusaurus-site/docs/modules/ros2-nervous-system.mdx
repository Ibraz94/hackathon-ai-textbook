# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts and architecture of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for advanced robotic applications. Students will learn how ROS 2 facilitates communication between different robotic components and how to define robot structures.

## Focus Areas

This module covers the following key topics and technologies:

*   **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding nodes, topics, services, actions, and parameters.
*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: Defining robot kinematics, dynamics, and visual properties.
*   **Message Passing**: Mechanisms for inter-process communication in ROS 2.
*   **ROS 2 Development Tools**: Using `colcon`, `ros2 run`, `ros2 topic`, `rviz2`.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

*   **KLO 1**: Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 and its communication mechanisms (nodes, topics, services, actions).
    *   *Example*: Students can explain the role of each ROS 2 primitive and their interactions.
*   **KLO 2**: Create and manage ROS 2 workspaces, packages, nodes, and message definitions.
    *   *Example*: Students can develop a simple publisher-subscriber pair in ROS 2.
*   **KLO 3**: Define a robot's physical and visual properties using URDF.
    *   *Example*: Students can create a URDF model for a simple robotic arm and visualize it in `rviz2`.

## Hardware Requirements (Optional, if applicable)

This module may utilize the following hardware components for practical exercises:

*   **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**: For deploying and testing basic ROS 2 applications on an edge device (optional for advanced exercises).

### Cloud/Virtual Access

Students can utilize cloud instances or virtual environments (e.g., Docker containers, AWS RoboMaker) for practical exercises involving ROS 2 development and simulation, abstracting away the need for physical hardware. Refer to the [Hardware Context](/docs/hardware-context) section for more details.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this module, students should have a basic understanding of:

*   Python programming (intermediate level)
*   C++ programming (beginner to intermediate level)
*   Linux command line basics
