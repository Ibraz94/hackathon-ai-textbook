# Constitution

The Constitution of the project outlines the guiding principles and architectural decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.

## Principles

1.  **Principle I: SpecifyPlus Architecture Mandate**: All tasks must be executable via `$SpecifyPlus$` commands. No manual source code manipulation is planned.
2.  **Principle II: Documentation-as-Code via Docusaurus**: All user-facing documentation, tutorials, or course materials are planned as Docusaurus-managed artifacts.
3.  **Principle III: Code Quality and Library Modernity**: The plan uses the latest stable versions of all proposed libraries and frameworks. The design adheres to established best practices.
4.  **Principle IV: Semantic Versioning for Releases**: The scope of changes is understood and will be aligned with a MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH release, as appropriate.
5.  **Governance V: Compliance and Auditing**: The plan acknowledges that all PRs will require two independent reviewers to confirm adherence to the core principles.
